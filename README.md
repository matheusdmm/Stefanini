# Hello dear Stefaniners ;)

This hackjob was made in about 35 minutes because I wasnt at home this weekend, so bear this in mind. Anyway, here comes Matheus hahaha.

I thought about doing it with firebase and Next.JS or doing the entire backend by myself, but I was tired and also in a serious need of coffe. Anyway, you can check my other stuff that I teached at Senai because I'm the System Development Teacher here.

In case of any trouble, you know how to reach me.

#libs
- react-router-dom
